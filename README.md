# Package subtest

Go 1.7 introduced subtests and sub-benchmarks. This package allows this
functionality to be used in a somewhat backwards compatible way.

Using subtest.Run wil get you all the features of subtests in Go 1.7.
Subtests pre-Go 1.7 will not be great, but at least all tests will be
run.
